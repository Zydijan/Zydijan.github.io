# Life as a Designer <br/>                                       

It was a train journey through the the mountain filled greens of Konkan. Just another compartment with a boy and a girl in it. It was about 5 in the evening, they were both enjoying the view outside the window. The view was then interrupted by a long tunnel. The girl picked her phone, but then she noticed the boy still looking at the window. She didn’t bother for a while but then she couldn’t wait anymore. She asked him, “Why are you looking at the window, its a tunnel. You can’t see anything”. Then he replied, “I was wondering why are the lights installed in here, when the trains have their own lights inside and with the electric line is through all the tunnel. So what is the need of these lights?” This boy was no one else but a design student.

This is one of those many moments that is when I realise how I’ve changed after joining a design school. Since 9th std. in school I had always been intrigued by those different product videos, be it phones, computers or even cars. I always wanted to be a part of the people who decided how these things look and what they consist of. That is when I found out that it was a Designer who I wanted to be. This when I started working towards it. Sketching products watching designing videos on YouTube was a normal thing. Always waiting for high-school to end so that I could choose design for my future education. Back then I would’ve never imagined myself to be what I am right now, as a design student.

Well the first thing one could think about is what exactly is designing? The simple answer would be to solve a problem by making a product, system or a service. But when college started this simple understanding of design started to diversify. We have subjects like Sociology, Business Communication and Design Research which shows how design is really not completely about the solution but more about the people who are actually going to use it. This fact that we design for people is really easy to take a glimpse at, but actually making it a part of your life is what makes a true designer. All those beautiful and precise product sketches mean nothing if they aren’t made for the people.

Life as a design student is different, apart form the fact that you have no textbooks. It changes your view on everything that you see. From all that you learn and more importantly “do” in college it affects you as person. The work that you do requires you to think different, break the norms, sit down on the floor instead of the desk and chair. These experiences in the college throughout the day is what makes it different from the other schools. Where teachers are nothing more than facilitators and classrooms are studios. That moment when design changes from being just a part of your life to being your life is when you become a true designer. This is when design stops being a final output and starts becoming more of a process.

Now I see a design school as an opportunity. An opportunity to explore yourself and what you are going to do in the future as a designer. The confidence of entering into the design community having knowledge about important subjects like communication, marketing, branding, Social and Culture aspects in addition to the basic design education is what makes this design school special. We as students have already started applying our knowledge in other scenarios than the assignments in college. The experience so far has been life changing, looking on to the upcoming future.
