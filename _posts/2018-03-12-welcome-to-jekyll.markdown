# Journey to a thing called love <br/> 

There's a thing in my mind <br/>
Struggling to get out <br/>
Finding way through the grind <br/>
But no it can't shout <br/>

What is next, I don't know <br/>
It's all about the thing that I told <br/>
Sometimes you just want to grow <br/>
Without just getting too old <br/>

Love may be what people say <br/>
I don't know what to say <br/>
Because I only want that one way <br/>
The way that leads to you <br/>

It may be today or tomorrow <br/>
But I think there's always a time <br/>
The time to find that you're grown <br/>
To find that it's not always what you pine <br/>

So just believe in that you <br/>
To always find the truth <br/>
But one day will surely come <br/>
When you find me and I find you <br/>
