# When India and USA come together in a video. <br/> 

We have always wanted to do something new with our covers on YouTube and we <br/> 
wanted to end this beautiful year of 2017 musically. So we came up with this idea <br/> 
of putting together a cover from two geographically different locations, India and <br/> 
the USA, in one video. This is again a new concept we tried, and we hope you like <br/> 
it. Pushing forward the boundaries of Music is something that we have always strive <br/> 
for, hence this effort. Many more Bass covers to come soon as well. <br/> 

by DK. <br/> 

Special thanks to Dhananjay Sande for putting efforts into the making of the video. <br/>
