# An original after years! <br/> 

Hey guys! <br/> 

It's been quite a time since we've uploaded any original songs. This doesn't mean <br/> 
that we've stopped working on them, they're being worked on all the time and perfected. <br/> 
This was a perfect opportunity to show this song to the public for the first time. <br/> 
Showcasing a new start for Simplicity! <br/> 

-AS <br/>
